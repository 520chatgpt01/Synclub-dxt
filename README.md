## Usage Guide

**1 - Script Generation**

- **Description**: Generates a comic script based on themes and summaries. If there are parts of the generated script that are unsatisfactory, adjustments can be made through instructions.
- **Prompt Input**
  - **Tips**: You can describe it in one sentence or use a structured output.
  - **Prompt Input Examples**:
    - **One-sentence description**: "A high school love story with a cool, academic female lead and a sunny, handsome athlete."
    - **Structured output example**: Scene: A mountaintop villa; Weather: Blizzard; Plot: Overbearing CEO A meets a little girl B who needs help, and they eventually fall in love.

**2 - Character Design Generation**

- **Description**: Generates character designs based on the provided appearance description, character gender, and selected base style. If there are parts of the generated character design that are unsatisfactory, adjustments can be made through instructions.
- **Base style selection**: Choose one of five base styles (Korean manhwa / game / illustration / anime / manga-specific) through dialogue.
- **Prompt Input Example**: "The overall style is illustration. The female lead has long, wavy brown hair with bangs and fair skin. The male lead is muscular, with a healthy complexion and a cheerful smile."

**3 - Text Storyboard Creation**

- **Description**: Based on the finalized script from Step 1 and the character information from Step 2, generates text storyboard results for a specified number of chapters (4–15 chapters). Each chapter includes a chapter description, character dialogue, and narration. If there are parts of the generated text storyboard that are unsatisfactory, adjustments can be made through instructions.
- **Generated Result Example**:
  - Chapter 1: The Promise of Cherry Blossoms
  - Description: A classroom bathed in spring warmth. Cherry blossom petals flutter outside the window.
  - Dialogue:
    - Yota Sato: "Hey, Takahashi-san, want to walk home together after school?"
    - Misaki Takahashi: "I have studying to do."
  - Narration: A fleeting glance at her fingertips.

**4 - Comic Generation**

- **Description**: First, finalize the character designs from Step 2. Then, convert the text storyboards from Step 3 into image prompts (this process is done automatically and not explicitly shown in the dialogue). Based on the generated image prompts and character information from Step 2, generate multiple comic images according to the number of chapters.
